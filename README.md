# MAN_of_the_MATCH
Project Title: Cricket Match Player Analysis

Description: Developed a Python application using Object-Oriented Programming principles to calculate and determine the Man of the Match based on custom criteria.
             Implemented multiple classes representing different player roles (Batsman, Bowler, All-Rounder, WicketKeeper) and encapsulated relevant attributes and methods.

Key Features:
Utilized inheritance to manage player attributes and behavior.
Calculated player points based on runs, wickets, catches, and other performance metrics.
Implemented logic to determine the highest-scoring player as the Man of the Match.
Technologies Used: Python, OOP

Skills Demonstrated: Python programming, OOP principles, data calculation, domain-specific modeling
